# marsRovers

In order to develop a solution writing clean code I decided to use OOP as much as possible.
The main objects are the Plateau and Rovers. I have created a main file "index.js" to handle the requests as well as a FileManager to read and write the input and output files.

The technologies used were Javascript, Node.js, Mocha.js and Chia.js.

I am fully aware that the testing section is lacking efficiency and was not very well structured. Unfortunately, I did not have as much free time as I would have liked to develop it properly.

#Instructions
- Clone the project.
- Execute: npm install
- There is an "input.txt" file in the root with a sample input. You can create another .txt file with a new input in order to test the code.
- Run "node index.js input.txt" or the name of the new input file.
- The result will be displayed in "output.txt"

  To run the test:
- Run the following command : npm run test.
